Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn&#39;t leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don&#39;t stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.</p><h2 id="branding" tabindex="-1">Branding <a class="header-anchor" href="#branding" aria-label="Permalink to “Branding”">​</a></h2><p>Headline: A healthy meal delivered to your door, every single day</p><p>Brand color: #e67e22</p><h2 id="omnifood-website-content" tabindex="-1">Omnifood Website Content <a class="header-anchor" href="#omnifood-website-content" aria-label="Permalink to “Omnifood Website Content”">​</a></h2><h3 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to “Summary”">​</a></h3><p>The smart 365-days-per-year food subscription that will make you eat healthy again.
