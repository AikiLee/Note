Q:Mr.Prime Minister, let's talk a little bit about yourself.

I heard that you have great passion for mathematics and for instance when people like me when we take on vacation you will spend some of your vacation time to look into unsolved mathematical problem and that is ==depicted==[^1] by some local media as revealing the geeky side of you every now and then back in your days in Cambridge they felt it was a pity for you to become a politician not a mathematician because you were ==back then==[^2] a rising star in the world of math.

Mr. Prime Minister, have you ever regret about this choice and how do you think your mastery of mathematics has influenced you in your approach of governance.

A: I don't regret I was not a rising star, I was a promising student, you're very being modest. It's a vast field and I did two undergraduate years in mathematics, so it's just barely at ==foothills==[^3], I enjoyed it I was not bad at it, but there are many more talented brilliant mathematicians in the world than me and I decided that I had a responsibility to come back to Singapore and be part of Singapore and do what I could to help country to succeed. It's a small country, It's was at that time a very small country the first few years of independence should make a difference should make a difference, and I thought I would like to do that at my best.
